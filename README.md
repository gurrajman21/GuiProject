# GuiProject
School project in which we created a program for a restuarant to take orders and print receipts. There is a command line version of the program as well as
a GUI version. The command line version does not have the option to print a receipt, instead it prints out receipt contents to the console. The GUI version
has a complete user interface in which the user can enter quantities of the food items and it displays subtotal, total and taxes in real time. The GUI 
Version also contains the print button which allows the receipt to be printed or saved as a pdf to the users machine.
